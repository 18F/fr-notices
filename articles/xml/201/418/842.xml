        <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
        <P>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) administers regulations published in title 27, chapter II, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). ATF identified several technical amendments that are needed to provide clarity and uniformity to 27 CFR regulations.</P>
        <P>Rather than make substantive changes to the regulations, these amendments generally focus on improving the clarity and accuracy of title 27, chapter II. Many of the technical changes reflect changes in nomenclature resulting from the transfer of ATF to the Department of Justice from the Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In addition, some changes are being made to reflect changes in the assignment of responsibility within ATF.</P>

        <HD SOURCE="HD1">How This Document Complies With the Federal Administrative Requirements for Rulemaking</HD>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Executive Order 12866 and Executive Order 13563</HD>
        <P>This rule has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, &#x201C;Regulatory Planning and Review,&#x201D; section 1(b), The Principles of Regulation, and Executive Order 13563, &#x201C;Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,&#x201D; section 1, General Principles of Regulation. This rule is limited to agency organization, management, or personnel matters as described by Executive Order 12866, section 3(d)(3) and, therefore, is not a &#x201C;regulation&#x201D; or &#x201C;rule&#x201D; as defined by that Executive Order.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Executive Order 13132</HD>
        <P>This final rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with section 6 of Executive Order 13132, &#x201C;Federalism,&#x201D; the Attorney General has determined that this regulation does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism summary impact statement.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Executive Order 12988</HD>
        <P>This regulation meets the applicable standards set forth in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, &#x201C;Civil Justice Reform.&#x201D;</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Administrative Procedure Act</HD>

        <P>The revisions to the regulations in this final rule are purely matters of agency organization, procedure, and practice that will not affect individual rights and obligations. As such, this rule is exempt from the usual requirements of prior notice and comment and a 30-day delay in the effective date.<E T="03">See</E>5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), (b)(3)(A), and (d)(3). Moreover, the Department finds good cause for exempting the rule from those requirements. Because this final rule makes technical corrections to improve the clarity of the regulations, the Department finds it unnecessary to publish this rule for public notice and comment. Similarly, because delaying the effective date of this rule would serve no purpose, the Department also finds good cause to make this rule effective upon publication.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
        <P>The Attorney General, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), has reviewed this rule and, by approving it, certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it pertains to personnel and administrative matters affecting the Department. Further, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required for this final rule because the Department was not required to publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking for this matter.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">F. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</HD>
        <P>This rule is not a major rule as defined by section 251 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. 804. This rule will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices; or significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>This rule will not result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year, and it will not significantly or uniquely affect small governments. Therefore, no actions were deemed necessary under the provisions of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1531-1535.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">H. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</HD>
        <P>This final rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3521.</P>
        <HD SOURCE="HD2">I. Congressional Review Act</HD>

        <P>This action pertains to agency organization, procedure, or practice, and does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties and, accordingly, is not a &#x201C;rule&#x201D; as that term is used by the Congressional Review Act (Subtitle E of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996).<E T="03">See</E>5 U.S.C. 804(3). Therefore, the reporting requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 does not apply.</P>
